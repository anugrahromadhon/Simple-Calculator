# Simple Calculator with Kivy

This is a simple calculator application built using **Kivy**, a Python library for developing multitouch applications. The calculator has a graphical user interface (GUI) with basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the ability to clear the display and evaluate expressions.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- Display results of calculations.
- Clear the display with a reset button (`C`).
- Handle invalid operations gracefully (displays "Error" in case of a mistake).

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Kivy**: A Python framework for building cross-platform applications (desktop and mobile).
- **GridLayout** for button arrangement.
- **TextInput** for the result display.

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Kivy library

To install Kivy, use the following command:

```bash
pip install kivy
```

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
3. Run the app using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
or
```bash
python main_2.py
```

This will launch the calculator app with the GUI, and it will be ready for use on your desktop.

## Usage

Once the application is running:

- **Number buttons (0-9)**: Tap to enter numbers.
- **Operator buttons (+, -, *, /)**: Tap to select the desired operation.
- **"C" button**: Tap to clear the input.
- **"=" button**: Tap to calculate and display the result.

### Input: 
`5 + 3 * 2`

### Output:
`11`
